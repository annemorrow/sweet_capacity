<p>Sweet Capacity is a play on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity" target="_blank">heat capacity</a> the extensive property of a material which determines the temperature change observed when heat energy is added or removed. Similarly, &#8220;sweet capacity&#8221; describes the property of increased human happiness with each subsequent morsel of delicious chocolate.</p>

<p>Like many of you reading this, Zak&#8217;s journey into the world of chocolate began by searching for more and better chocolate. He accidentally stumbled upon <a href="http://www.chocolate-academy.com/us/en/usa" target="_blank">Barry Callebaut&#8217;s Chocolate Academy</a>, attended, and realized that his background in chemistry could be APPLIED to the practical problem of increasing confections&#8217; Sweet Capacity.</p>
